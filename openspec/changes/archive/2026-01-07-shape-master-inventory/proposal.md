# Change: Document flowchart shape master mapping

## Why
Mermaid flowchart shape names need a documented mapping to Visio masters to guide implementation and validation.

## What Changes
- Add a mapping table for flowchart shape names to Visio masters (including rotation/notes).
- Record the mapping in the existing design reference.

## Impact
- Affected specs: flowchart-shapes (new)
- Affected code: design/2026-01-06_23-44-40-flowchart-shape-support/shape-master-inventory.md; md2visio.vssx (read-only inventory)
