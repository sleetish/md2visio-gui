# Change: Audit sequence layout context

## Why
Sequence layout spacing issues are hard to diagnose without a shared reference that captures current layout inputs and draw order.

## What Changes
- Add developer documentation describing current sequence layout inputs, spacing constants, and draw order.
- Establish a baseline OpenSpec capability for sequence layout documentation.

## Impact
- Affected specs: sequence-layout
- Affected code: docs/sequence-layout-context.md
