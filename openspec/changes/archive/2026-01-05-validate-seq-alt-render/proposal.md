# Change: Add alt fragment validation sample

## Why
We need a concrete sample that exercises alt fragments and notes to validate fragment scoping and note layout.

## What Changes
- Add a sequence sample with alt branches and notes in md2visio/test/sequence.md.
- Update validation sample requirement to reference alt/note coverage.

## Impact
- Affected specs: openspec/specs/sequence-layout/spec.md
- Affected code: md2visio/test/sequence.md
